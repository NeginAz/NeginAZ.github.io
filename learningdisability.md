title: Interactive Robotic Activities for Children with Learning Disabilities
---
### Description: 
- Partnered with [Learning Disabilities Society](https://ldsociety.ca)
- Children with learning disabilities often struggle to maintain focus on their tasks
- Designed, and implemented a robotic system to help instructors keep the students engaged
- The robot provides strategies such as breathing exercises, and games 
- Developed a user-friendly interface solution on the tablet 
- The robot made a positive impression on both students and instructors and improved students' engagement rate
- Children played games with the robot through a tablet


<h4> Data Sources</h4>

- Behavioral Data: Observations of on-task and off-task behaviors during sessions.
- Engagement Metrics: Tracking student engagement through task completion, redirection strategies (RS), and mood reflections.
- Instructors' Feedback: Qualitative data collected from instructors regarding their perceptions of the robotâ€™s effectiveness and student engagement.
- Mood Reflection: Students reflected their mood using a worksheet at the beginning and end of each session.

<h4> Data Analysis </h4>
<h5> Quantitative Analysis:</h5>

- Comparison of on-task behavior and task completion between the traditional "Instruction As Usual" (IAU) sessions and "Robot-Mediated Instruction" (RMI) sessions.
- Statistical analysis to assess the impact of the robot on student engagement and redirection effectiveness.

 <h5> Qualitative Analysis: </h5>
 
- Instructor feedback on robot intervention, including ease of use, effectiveness, and student response.
- Analysis of the types of off-task behaviors exhibited by students and preferred redirection strategies.
