title: Optical Character Recognition for old writings
---




- Cuneiform script is an ancient writing method used for languages such as Old Persian, Sumerian, and Babylonian.
- The script consists of 37 characters and is associated with inscriptions from the Achaemenid period.
- Due to the limited number of experts in ancient languages and the historical importance of these writings, this research focuses on automating the reading and translation of ancient texts.
- A key objective is to select the most suitable algorithm for data classification, given the scarcity of cuneiform resources.
- The study evaluates different methods, with the best approach being reported.
