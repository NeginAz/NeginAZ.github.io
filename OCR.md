title: Optical Character Recognition for old writings
---




- Cuneiform script is an ancient writing method used for languages such as Old Persian, Sumerian, and Babylonian.
- The script consists of 37 characters and is associated with inscriptions from the Achaemenid period.
- Due to the limited number of experts in ancient languages and the historical importance of these writings, this research focuses on automating the reading and translation of ancient texts.
- A key objective is to select the most suitable algorithm for data classification, given the scarcity of cuneiform resources.
- The study evaluates different methods, with the best approach being reported.

<h4>Methods</h4>
- Due to the limited number of samples for each character, samples of each character were first collected from the text images using the Template Matching method.

For better classification performance, the dataset was created as images with a black background. Then, similar samples of each character were generated using autoencoders.
