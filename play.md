title: Collaborative Game Through A Robot Play Mediator
---


- Conducted experiments with human participants, operating robots through two joysticks
- Collected and analyzed data from heart rate sensors, joysticks, and videos
- Developed evaluation metrics based on physiological sensor data joystick usage, and behavioural cues

<h4>Participants</h4>

- Initially, children with upper-limb disorders were the target group. However, due to Covid-19 restrictions, university students were recruited as participants to collect preliminary data.
- Two Participants per Session: Participants played collaborative games with the robot, each controlling part of the robotâ€™s movement.

- Collaborative Game Setup: Two types of collaborative games were designed where participants controlled a robot through adaptive joysticks. In one game, players shared tasks, while in the other, they needed to coordinate their actions for joint outcomes.
- Joystick Data: Data was collected on how participants used the joystick, focusing on frequency, magnitude, and coordination of commands.
- Video Recordings: Sessions were recorded to observe communication, coordination, and interaction between players.
- Heart Rate Monitoring: Physiological data (heart rate) was collected to assess the level of engagement and emotional responses during play.


<h4> Tools: </h4>

- MyJay Robot: A mobile robot designed as a play mediator for the participants.
- Adaptive Joysticks: Customized joysticks designed to accommodate movement impairments.
- Video Recording Setup: Used to capture the gameplay and analyze player behavior.
- Heart Rate Sensors: Monitored participants' heart rate to evaluate engagement and emotional responses.

<h4> Data Analysis: </h4>

 <h5> Quantitative Analysis: </h5>
 
- Joystick Usage: Analyzed the frequency and magnitude of joystick commands, focusing on how participants coordinated their actions in both the shared and fusion game conditions.
- Heart Rate Data: Analyzed heart rate changes to gauge the level of emotional and cognitive engagement during the games.
<h5> Qualitative Analysis: </h5>

- Communication and Coordination: Video data was coded to analyze how participants communicated and coordinated their actions during the games.
- Behavioral Events: Observed and categorized different types of interactions between players, such as joint action and turn-taking, to assess the impact of collaboration strategies on gameplay.






<h4> Findings: </h4>

- Coordination vs. Task Sharing: In the fusion condition, participants were required to coordinate their actions, resulting in more collaborative behavior compared to the shared condition, where they each controlled separate tasks.
- Engagement and Collaboration: Participants showed higher levels of engagement in the fusion condition, indicated by heart rate changes and more synchronized actions.
- Successful Play Mediation: The robot effectively mediated play, helping participants engage in collaborative tasks, and demonstrated the potential to support children with upper-limb disabilities in social play.
